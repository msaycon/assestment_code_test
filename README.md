Assesment Project

Used MVVM architecture in this project cause of the following reasons

- Easy to debug and finding errors because of separation of concerns
- For future testing of functions
- Easily change data repository without changing in views
- Maintainable codes

For easy navigation and changing of view I used android navigation component/ navigation architecture.
